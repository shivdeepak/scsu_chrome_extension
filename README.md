# YC Startup School - Fix LinkedIn URL

YC Startup School Co-Founder Matching is an excellent place to find and meet people who are interested in building startups.

The "View on LinkedIn" link on the user profiles is broken because of an error in the HTML markup, and this extension fixes that.

It is a very light weight extension, and completely safe to use. It doesn't collect any data, and it doesn't make any network requests. You can audit the source at https://github.com/shivdeepak/ycsu_chrome_extension/blob/main/content.js
